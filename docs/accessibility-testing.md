# Accessibility Testing Guide

This guide outlines the testing procedures and tools used in Access.Able to ensure Universal Design compliance and accessibility.

## Testing Philosophy

Access.Able follows a comprehensive testing approach that goes beyond basic WCAG compliance to ensure genuine usability for people with diverse abilities.

## Automated Testing Tools

### Core Testing Stack
- **axe-core** - Automated accessibility testing
- **Lighthouse** - Performance and accessibility auditing  
- **Pa11y** - Command-line accessibility testing
- **WAVE** - Web accessibility evaluation

### Custom Validation
- **Universal Design Validator** - Custom ruleset mapping code to the 7 principles
- **Color Contrast Analyzer** - Advanced contrast checking beyond WCAG minimums
- **Keyboard Navigation Validator** - Automated tab order and focus management testing

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Screen Reader Testing
Test with multiple screen readers to ensure broad compatibility:

**NVDA (Windows)**
- Navigate using screen reader shortcuts
- Test form completion and submission
- Verify dynamic content announcements
- Check table navigation and data relationships

**JAWS (Windows)**
- Test complex interactions and widgets
- Verify custom ARIA implementations
- Check virtual cursor navigation
- Test with different verbosity settings

**VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)**
- Test gesture navigation on mobile
- Verify rotor navigation
- Check custom control announcements
- Test with different speaking rates

**TalkBack (Android)**
- Test touch exploration
- Verify gesture shortcuts
- Check reading order and grouping
- Test with different granularity settings

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
**Tab Order Verification**
- Logical tab sequence through all interactive elements
- No keyboard traps (can always navigate away)
- Skip links for efficient navigation
- Focus indicators are clearly visible

**Keyboard Shortcuts**
- Standard shortcuts work as expected (Escape, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- Custom shortcuts don't conflict with assistive technology
- Shortcuts are documented and discoverable
- Alternative methods exist for all shortcuts

### Visual Testing
**Color and Contrast**
- Test with various color blindness types (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia)
- Verify information isn't conveyed by color alone
- Check contrast at different zoom levels
- Test in high contrast mode

**Zoom and Scaling**
- Test at 200% zoom (WCAG requirement)
- Verify layout doesn't break at 400% zoom
- Check text reflow and readability
- Ensure all functionality remains available

**Motion and Animation**
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Provide pause/stop controls for auto-playing content
- Ensure animations don't trigger vestibular disorders
- Test with motion sensitivity settings

## Testing Scenarios

### User Journey Testing
Test complete user flows with assistive technology:

1. **First-time User**
   - Account creation with screen reader
   - Initial app building via keyboard only
   - Understanding generated accessibility features

2. **Power User**
   - Complex app creation with multiple accessibility requirements
   - GitHub integration and remediation workflow
   - Advanced customization with assistive technology

3. **Collaborative Use**
   - Multiple users with different abilities working on same project
   - Sharing and reviewing accessibility improvements
   - Team workflows with mixed assistive technology usage

### Edge Case Testing
- Very long content and navigation
- Complex data tables and forms
- Dynamic content updates and notifications
- Error states and recovery procedures
- Offline functionality with assistive technology

## Performance Testing

### Assistive Technology Performance
- Screen reader responsiveness with large DOM trees
- Keyboard navigation speed with complex layouts
- Voice control accuracy with generated interfaces
- Switch navigation efficiency

### Load Testing
- Performance impact of accessibility features
- Screen reader compatibility under load
- Keyboard navigation during heavy processing
- Focus management during async operations

## Compliance Validation

### WCAG 2.2 AA Checklist
- [ ] **Perceivable**
  - [ ] Text alternatives for images
  - [ ] Captions for videos
  - [ ] Sufficient color contrast
  - [ ] Resizable text up to 200%

- [ ] **Operable**
  - [ ] Keyboard accessible
  - [ ] No seizure-inducing content
  - [ ] Sufficient time limits
  - [ ] Clear navigation

- [ ] **Understandable**
  - [ ] Readable text
  - [ ] Predictable functionality
  - [ ] Input assistance
  - [ ] Error identification

- [ ] **Robust**
  - [ ] Compatible with assistive technologies
  - [ ] Valid HTML markup
  - [ ] Future-proof code structure

### Universal Design Validation
Each generated component is scored against all 7 Universal Design principles:

1. **Equitable Use Score** (0-100)
2. **Flexibility Score** (0-100)
3. **Simplicity Score** (0-100)
4. **Perceptibility Score** (0-100)
5. **Error Tolerance Score** (0-100)
6. **Low Effort Score** (0-100)
7. **Size & Space Score** (0-100)

**Overall Universal Design Score**: Average of all principle scores

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing Pipeline
```yaml
# Example CI configuration
accessibility_tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Run axe-core tests
      run: npm run test:a11y
    - name: Lighthouse accessibility audit
      run: npm run audit:lighthouse
    - name: Universal Design validation
      run: npm run validate:universal-design
    - name: Screen reader compatibility
      run: npm run test:screen-reader
```

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 95% accessibility score required for deployment
- All Universal Design principles must score above 80
- Zero critical accessibility violations allowed
- Manual testing sign-off required for complex interactions
